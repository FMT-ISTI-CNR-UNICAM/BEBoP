		<ContentPlain>MAJOR EVENT PROTOCOL

Scope

The City of Austin has established a major event initiative that is supported by the Police Department, EMS and Fire Department. This initiative creates a team of city personnel to handle any incident of natural or manmade disasters that occur in the City of Austin. This team is responsible for search and rescue, investigation and assisting other agencies responsible for major events. Command Staff will determine whether an incident demands major event status.

Responsibilities

1. Major Event Team
A. Made up of Police Department personnel who are placed in areas of responsibility within
their expertise.
B. Each employee is assigned to a specific team and answers to command staff in that
team.
C. Personnel will be divided into these two groups, Alpha and Bravo, to handle the major
event scene, while continuing essential functions in the area of crime scene and evidence control.
2. The group will include personnel assigned to the major event and personnel assigned to other essential functions.
3. Positions, not individuals, are assigned to specific duties.
A. Individual assignments will be made at the time the major event schedule is initiated. B. The assignments must remain flexible, dependent on the type and extent of the major
event.
4. The two teams will work 12-hour shifts/7 days per week, until the major event status is terminated.
5. Shifts will be 7am/7pm and 7pm/7am.

response.

be unavailable.

onset of a major event.
