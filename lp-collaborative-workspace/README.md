# Summary
The Collaborative Workspace is the main entry-point for end-user.  It's the
place where learners will browse the documented processes.  For more
information, see the
[http://wiki.learnpad.eu/LearnPAdWiki/bin/view/Component/Collaborative+workspace](wiki).

# How it works?
Based on XWiki, the processes are transformed into a XWiki structure of data.
On top of these data, there is a application that will allow to display and
browse these data in a user-friendly interface.

This application is developed with XWiki scripts.  To help in this development,
a XWiki service has been provided to facilitate access to data.

# Configuration
Since this component is based on XWiki, the configuration is mainly specific to
XWiki.  You should find any information on
[http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Documentation](xwiki.org).

# Interfaces
You can see the description of interfaces on the
