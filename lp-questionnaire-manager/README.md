# Summary
The questionnaire manager supports the generation of questionnaires from Business Process models.
Also it provides the functionality for the Learn PAd platform to retrieve and publish a questionnaire.
Notably the creation of a questionnaire could be either automatic or interactive. 
Also in the following each questionnaire is conceived as a template composed by a set of questions
that should be submitted to a learner, where each question has (optionally) associated its expected answer.
