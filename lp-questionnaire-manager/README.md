# Summary
This component is a template that you can use to start your own new component.
It's not intended to be a part of the builded system.  You'll find more
information and documentation about this component
http://wiki.learnpad.eu/LearnPAdWiki/bin/view/Components/Template(here).

# Configuration
You must describe the different possible configurations of your component.  It
can be documentation in this file or a link to a wiki page.

# How it works?
You may want to describe how the component is working.  It will make it easier
for other to collaborate to this component.

# Interfaces
You must define and detail all communications with external components or
systems.

## API
If you're defining an API, create an exhaustive reference of what is available.

## External calls
At the very least, list here any other component or system that you
need to call or use.
