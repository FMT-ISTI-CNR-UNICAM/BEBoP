ActivityDescription.Description=The modeler should provide a brief description for each activity in the model (if the tool allows it).
ActivityDescription.Name=Activity Description
ActivityDescription.SuggestionKO=\nPlease add Activity Description in element:
ActivityDescription.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ActivityDescription.SuggestionSubprocessKO=\nPlease add Activity Description in SubProcess 
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.Description=The modeler should create a hierarchical Business Process Model with multi layers of details for the Process. BPMN sub-processes are used to split the Process into â\u20AC\u0153phasesâ\u20AC\uFFFD or â\u20AC\u0153layersâ\u20AC\uFFFD. The modeler can expand the sub-processes later to expose details of lower levels of hierarchy. A process model will contain multiple pages, but internally the integrity of a single model is maintained.
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.Name=Apply hierarchical structure with SubProcesses
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.SuggestionKO=Apply hierarchical structure with SubProcesses: 
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
GuidelinesFactory.KO=KO
GuidelinesFactory.KODescription=Please follow these guidelines:
GuidelinesFactory.OK=OK
GuidelinesFactory.OKDescription=Well done, no errors found\!
Generic.LabelEmpty=Unlabeled
LinearMessageFlows.Description=Linear message flows without useless foldings help to maintain the model clear.
LinearMessageFlows.Name=Linear Message Flows
LinearMessageFlows.SuggestionKO=Use Linear Message Flows: 
LinearMessageFlows.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
LinearSequenceFlows.Description=Linear sequence flows without useless foldings help to maintain the model clear.
LinearSequenceFlows.Name=Linear sequence flows
LinearSequenceFlows.SeggetionOK=Well done\!
LinearSequenceFlows.SuggestionKO=Use Linear sequence flows: 
MinimizeGatewayHeterogeneity.Description=The modeler should minimize the heterogeneity of gateway types. The use of several type of gateway may cause confusion against the simplicity of using few main type of gateways.
MinimizeGatewayHeterogeneity.Name=Minimize Gateway Heterogeneity
MinimizeGatewayHeterogeneity.SuggestionKO=Minimize Gateway Heterogeneity 
MinimizeGatewayHeterogeneity.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
MinimizeGatewayHeterogeneity.SuggestionSubprocessKO=\nMinimize Gateway Heterogeneity in SubProcess 
MinimizeModelSize.Description=The modeler should try to keep models as small as possible. Large process models are difficult to read and comprehend. Additionally, they tend to contain more errors. Defining the correct scope of tasks and level of detail of processes is key to reduce the overage of information.
MinimizeModelSize.Name=Minimize Model Size
MinimizeModelSize.SuggestionKO=Too much elements %s. Please use max 31  the number of nodes: number of activities and routing elements in a process model
MinimizeModelSize.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ModelLoops.Description=Where possible, and if this practice contributes to simplify the model, the modeler should model a loop via activity looping (with the loop marker) instead of using a sequence flow looping.
ModelLoops.Name=Model loops via activity looping
ModelLoops.SuggestionKO=Model loops via activity looping: 
ModelLoops.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ProcessOrientation.Description=The modeler should draw pools horizontally and use consistent layout with horizontal sequence flows, and vertical message flows and associa- tions.
ProcessOrientation.Name=Process Orientation
ProcessOrientation.SuggestionKO=Change Process Orientation: 
ProcessOrientation.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
