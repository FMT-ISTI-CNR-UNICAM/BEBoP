ApplyHierarchicalStructure.Description=The modeler should create a hierarchical Business Process Model with multi layers of details for the Process. BPMN sub-processes are used to split the Process into â\u20AC\u0153phasesâ\u20AC\uFFFD or â\u20AC\u0153layersâ\u20AC\uFFFD. The modeler can expand the sub-processes later to expose details of lower levels of hierarchy. A process model will contain multiple pages, but internally the integrity of a single model is maintained.
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.Name=Apply hierarchical structure with SubProcesses
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.SuggestionKO=Apply hierarchical structure with SubProcesses: 
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
BalanceGateways.Description=The modeler should always use the same type of gateway used both for splitting and joining the flow. For example, when a flow is divided with a parallel gateway, the resulting parallel flows should be consolidated via another parallel gateway. In particular, the modeler should ensure that join parallel gateways have the correct number of incoming sequence flow-especially when used in conjunction with other gateways; this is related to ensuring the soundness property. Donâ\u20AC\u2122t apply this guidelines on Event-based or Complex Gateways.

ConsistentUsageEndEvents.Description=The modeler should distinguish success and failure end states in a process or a sub-process with separate end events. Flows that end in the same end state should be merged to the same end event. Therefore, separate end events that do not represent distinct end states must be merged in a single end event.
ConsistentUsageEndEvents.Name=Consistent Usage of End Events
ConsistentUsageEndEvents.SuggestionKO=\nUse only one End Events :
ConsistentUsageEndEvents.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ConsistentUsageEndEvents.SuggestionSubprocessKO=\nUse only one End Event in SubProcess 
ConsistentUsageLanes.Description=The modeler should model internal organizational units as lanes within a single process pool, not as separate pools; separate pools imply independent processes. Create a lane, in a pool, only if at least one activity or intermediate event is performed in it.
ConsistentUsageLanes.Name=Consistent usage of lanes
ConsistentUsageLanes.SuggestionKO=\nLabeling Lanes:
ConsistentUsageLanes.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ConsistentUsagePools.Description=The modeler should define as many pools as processes and/or participants. Use a black-box pool to represent external participant/processes. The modeled pools need to be in relation with each other and have to be linked to the main process through message exchange.

LabelingEvents.SuggestionSubProcessKO=\nUse Labeling in Events of the SubProcess 
LabelingLanes.Description=Lanes must always have a label. The label should identify the responsi- ble entity for the process. Lanes are often used for representing things as internal roles (e.g., manager, associate), systems (e.g., an enterprise application), or internal departments (e.g., shipping, finance).

LabelingLanes.SuggestionKO=\nLabeling Lanes:
LabelingLanes.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
LabelingMessageEvent.Decription=Whenever the modeler uses a message event he should draw the message flow, and label the event. When a focus on the message itself is required, the modeler can represent a message icon and label it with the name of the message.

LabelingPools.Description=The modeler should label pools using the participantâ\u20AC\u2122s name. The main pool can be labeled using the process name. If a pool is present in a subprocess, the name of the pool must be the same of the upper-level process pool which includes the subprocess activity. This means that the pool of the upper-level process and the pool of the subprocess needs to be the same.
LabelingPools.Name=Labeling Pools

LabelingStartandEndEvents.Description=The modeler should not label start none and end none event if there is only one instance of them. The modeler shoud use labeling when multiple start and end events are used. Label them according to what they represent using a noun. Do not repeat names.

MinimizeModelSize.Description=The modeler should try to keep models as small as possible. Large process models are difficult to read and comprehend. Additionally, they tend to contain more errors. Defining the correct scope of tasks and level of detail of processes is key to reduce the overage of information.
